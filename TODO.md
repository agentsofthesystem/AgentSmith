## To get to version 0.0.2

1. Add github actions.

  - Add docs for how a dev can add a new game.
  - Add docs for user docs with vrising example to install/use game. 

# Nice to haves.

1. ~~Get rid of tabs on the Game control gui. Move settings under its own button on main system tray.  Get rid of
   summary table. Not really useful.~~ 
2. Make the gui layout all nice a good looking. (Not my thing...)
